## Abstract

In *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, the transcription factor Cst6p plays a crucial role in various biological processes. This study provides the first high-resolution genome-wide mapping of Cst6p's binding sites, revealing its condition-dependent binding to 59 genes' promoter regions during ethanol growth, contrasting with negligible binding during glucose growth. The impaired growth on ethanol of CST6 deletion mutants is linked to reduced expression of NCE103, a carbonic anhydrase and direct Cst6p target. The study highlights Cst6p's overlap with stress-responsive transcription factors Sko1p and Skn7p, situating Cst6p within a complex, stress-responsive transcriptional network. These findings illuminate the intricate, condition-dependent transcriptional regulatory network in *S. cerevisiae*.

## Introduction

This study investigates the transcription factor Cst6p in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, focusing on its genome-wide binding sites and biological functions. Previous research has suggested Cst6p's involvement in several biological processes, but its genome-wide targets and physiological roles remained unexplored until now. By mapping Cst6p's binding sites under different growth conditions, the research aims to uncover the transcription factor's regulatory effects and its integration into the yeast's stress-responsive networks.

## Methods

### ChIP-seq Analysis

- **Objective**: To identify the genome-wide binding sites of Cst6p in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* and understand its role under different growth conditions.
- **Sample Preparation and Sequencing**: Cells were cultured in both ethanol and glucose mediums to investigate the condition-dependent binding behavior of Cst6p.
- **Data Processing**: Employed high-resolution techniques to map Cst6p's binding across the genome, focusing on the promoter regions of genes.

## Results

Cst6p showed a strong preference for binding to the promoters of 59 genes during ethanol growth, impacting genes with diverse biological functions. This binding pattern was markedly different during glucose growth, where Cst6p binding was minimal. The study directly linked the slower growth on ethanol of CST6 deletion mutants to the downregulation of NCE103, a direct target of Cst6p. Additionally, Cst6p's target genes significantly overlapped with those regulated by other stress-responsive transcription factors, indicating Cst6p's role in the yeast's stress response mechanisms.

## Discussion

The findings significantly contribute to our understanding of Cst6p's regulatory roles in *S. cerevisiae*, particularly its conditional activity and integration into stress response pathways. This research underscores the complexity of yeast's transcriptional regulatory network, influenced by environmental conditions.

2. **Data Visualization**: Skills in visualizing genomic data to interpret the spatial relationship between transcription factor binding sites and gene regulation.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Experience in analyzing condition-dependent gene expression and its biological implications.
4. **Integration with Other Genomic Data**: Understanding of how to integrate ChIP-seq data with other types of genomic data to construct a holistic view of transcriptional regulation.

## Conclusion

This study sheds light on the complex roles of Cst6p in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, revealing its condition-dependent binding patterns and its pivotal role in the yeast's stress response mechanisms. The findings offer a deeper insight into the dynamic transcriptional regulatory network in yeast, providing a foundation for further investigations into the stress response and regulatory mechanisms.
