Objective: To identify the genome-wide binding sites of Cst6p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and understand its role under different growth conditions.

Sample Preparation and Sequencing: Cells were cultured in both ethanol and glucose mediums to investigate the condition-dependent binding behavior of Cst6p.

Data Processing: Employed high-resolution techniques to map Cst6p's binding across the genome, focusing on the promoter regions of genes.
